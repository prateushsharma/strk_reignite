## No-Code Components

### Agent Node
The core component that coordinates all aspects of your AI agent.
- **Settings**: Name, description, UID
- **Connections**: Can connect to models, memory stores, and tools

### Model Node
Configures the AI model that powers your agent's intelligence.
- **Models Available**: Claude, Gemini, GPT-4, etc.
- **Settings**: Context length, temperature, token limit

### Memory Node
Adds memory capabilities to your agent.
- **Memory Types**: 
  - Short-term (session)
  - Long-term (Redis)
  - Vector store (for retrieval)
- **Settings**: Storage duration, indexing options

### Tool Node
Integrates external tools and APIs with your agent.
- **Tool Types**:
  - Trading API
  - Data analysis
  - Web search
  - Custom API calls
- **Settings**: API parameters, authentication

### Strategy Node
Defines trading and decision-making strategies.
- **Strategy Types**:
  - Momentum trading
  - Mean reversion
  - Trend following
  - Custom strategies
- **Settings**: Time frames, indicators, thresholds

## Example Use Cases

### Trading Bot
Build an agent that analyzes market data and executes trades based on predefined strategies:
1. Agent Node (core)
2. Model Node (for analysis)
3. Memory Node (to track trade history)
4. Tool Node (trading API)
5. Strategy Node (trading logic)

### Market Analyzer
Create an agent that analyzes market trends and sends notifications:
1. Agent Node (core)
2. Model Node (for analysis)
3. Memory Node (to track historical data)
4. Tool Node (market data API)
5. Notification Node (for alerts)

## Security & Privacy

- **Wallet Security**: We never store your private keys
- **Data Privacy**: Your agent configurations are encrypted
- **On-Chain Security**: Transactions are secured by the StarkNet blockchain
- **UID Protection**: Your agent's UID is password-protected by your wallet address
